# HR Analytics- Job Change of Data Scientists


#### Abstract




#### Project Goals
> - Find features for Job Change of Data Scientist

> - Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts who will move to a new job


## Dataset
> - This data is being pulled from Kaggle.

> - The following link contains the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists?select=sample_submission.csv

> - When downloaded, you will have a three .csv files. The dataset I used was aug_train.csv

#### Data Dictionary
    
- This is a data dictionary as a reference for the variables used within in the data set. A sample of what is included in data dictionary is below. Please refer to zillow_data_dictionary.csv for more details.


 |   Target    |  Data Type   | Description    |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
| target| float64|  – Not looking for job change, 1 – Looking for a job change



|   Feature      |  Data Type   | Description    |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|  enrollee_id | int64   | Unique ID for candidate |
| city   | object | City code|
| city_ development _index  | float64 | Development index of the city (scaled) |
| gender | object   | Gender of candidate|
| relevent_experience | object | Relevant experience of candidate|
| enrolled_university  | object |  Type of University course enrolled if any|
| education_level | object | Education level of candidate|
| major_discipline | object | Education major discipline of candidate|



#### Initial Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1:
> - **Hypothesis 1 -** I rejected the Null Hypothesis; there is a relationship.
> - alpha = .05
> - $H_0$: Company type has no affect on data scientist who leave their job or not (they are independent). 
> - $H_a$: Company type has an affect on data scientist who leave their job or not (they are dependent). 

### Hypothesis 2:
> - **Hypothesis 2 -** I rejected the Null Hypothesis; there is a relationship.
> - alpha = .05
> - $H_0$:  Relevant experience has no affect on data scientist who leave their job or not (they are independent). 
> - $H_a$:  Relevant experience has an affect on data scientist who leave their job or not (they are dependent).

### Hypothesis 3:
> - **Hypothesis 3 -** I rejected the Null Hypothesis; there is a relationship.
> - alpha = .05
> - $H_0$: Status of university enrollment has no affect on data scientist who leave their job or not (they are independent). 
> - $H_a$: Status of university enrollment has an affect on data scientist who leave their job or not (they are dependent).

### Executive Summary - Conclusions & Next Steps
<hr style="border-top: 10px groove blueviolet; margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 1px"></hr>
<b>The following are key takeways:</b>

  -There is not one main driver for job change of Data Scientists.
 
  - All models performed similarly except for KNeighbors had a lower accuracy score than the baseline
  
  - The models I created were a Decision tree, Logistic Regression Model, KNeighbors, and Random Forest Model predicted similar accuracy scores for the training dataset except for KNeighbors. The model I chose was the Decision Tree model 2 as my best model with a 75.52% accuracy rate for predicting features of company type, relevent experience, status of university enrollment, and last new job.
  
  -  The Decision Tree model 2 (75.52%) outperformed my baseline score of 75.09% thus it has some value.
  

- With more time:
  - I would have encoded and binned the experience and company_size columns
  - I would have worked with more hyperparameters to improve the models
  - I would utilize clustering to create more features
